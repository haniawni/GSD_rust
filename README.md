# Executive Function Prosthesis

Hi!
It's in Rust and uses Diesel and Rocket. My personal setup will use DialogFlow to have a convenient spoken or chatbot interface.

If everything is magical, my setup of this will use the bracer wearable I've had stuck in my headforever, perhaps in tandem with the ohmglove design.

Regardless, this is intended to swap in for my own executive functioning, helping track ideas, avoid avoidance, make good use of my life, and carry endeavors thru to completion.
